# api-express-nodejs-reactjs-react-native-app
I've made this repository in order to put my new full stack skills into it, I've made API that creates a unique ID (key) for each project and then you can add more projects into the front-end web or the mobile app. It's simples but functional!
## Here we've got the view of the app working:

#To get it working you will need to use 

npm-install 

at backend, frontend and mobile (to get the dependencies into it)

# Running the project
you'll also need 3 terminal windows

run the backend by running the command:

npm run dev

then run the mobile by running the command (Metro bundler):

npm start

only then you can run:

npx react-native run-android

I'm just using react and not installing it globally because it can cause some errors.
