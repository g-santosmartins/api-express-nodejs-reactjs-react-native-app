# api-express-nodejs-reactjs-react-native-app
I've made this repository in order to put my new full stack skills into it, I've made API that creates a unique ID (key) for each project and then you can add more projects into the front-end web or the mobile app. It's simples but functional!

#To get it working you will need to use 

npm-install 

at backend, frontend and mobile (to get the dependencies into it)
