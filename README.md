# api-express-nodejs-reactjs-react-native-app
I've made this repository in order to put my new full stack skills into it, I've made API that creates a unique ID (key) for each project and then you can add more projects into the front-end web or the mobile app. It's simples but functional!
## Here we've got the view of the app working:

#To get it working you will need to use 

``npm-install`` 


at backend, frontend and mobile (to get the dependencies into it)

# Running the project
![How many terminal windows](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62312282/115793874-4ce4ec80-a3a3-11eb-9e19-e7efa2f7dc81.jpeg)
you'll also need 3 terminal windows

run the backend by running the command:

``npm run dev``

then run the mobile by running the command (Metro bundler):

``npm start``

only then you can run:

``npx react-native run-android ``

I'm just using react and not installing it globally because it can cause some errors.
